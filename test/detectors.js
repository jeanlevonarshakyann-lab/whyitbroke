// extractor can quietly remove, at which point the wrong parser starts diagnosing the
// wrong tool and nothing fails.

  // about which three, and goes on passing when one fixture stops degrading and another
  // starts. deno's assertion block, ruff's fix hint and PHPUnit's testdox body each lose
  // one finding when a line lands inside them. oxlint's drawn report loses a finding with
  // no rule: nothing but an unbroken report down to oxlint's own closing lines says it
  // is oxlint's, because swc draws the same box. go's import chain is adjacency and
  // nothing else - "A imports" on one line and "B: reason" on the next is the only thing
  // that says B is what A could not get - so a line landing between them leaves no chain
  // to read, and refusing is the whole point of requiring them to be adjacent.

// Runaway backtracking.

// `\s` matches a newline, so `/^\s+at /m` at a blank line consumes every remaining
// newline in the log and then walks all the way back looking for "at" - once per line.
// A log with a long run of blank or whitespace-only lines therefore costs quadratic
// time, and eight extractors used to spend five to seventeen seconds each on one.
// Nothing about that input is exotic: any log with a lot of vertical space hits it.
//
// The budget is deliberately loose. Fixed, these finish in single-digit milliseconds;
// broken, they took thousands. A slow CI machine cannot cross that gap.
