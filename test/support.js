// What whyitbroke reads, and what stands behind each claim that it does.
//
// The supported-tools table says which tools whyitbroke reads and what you get from each: a row
// is a promise, a parser is the code that keeps it, and a fixture is a real capture it is
// kept against. test/support.json says which rows each parser answers for. This holds the
// three to each other - no parser without a row, no row without a parser, no capture that
// no test reads - and test/detectors.js holds each parser to reading a capture of its own.
// CONTRIBUTING lists the rest of what admits a tool.
