## Adding a parser

1. Capture real output from the tool on a failing run. Do not hand-write a
   fixture that only resembles the tool output.
2. Remove usernames, absolute home directories, repository names, tokens,
   URLs with credentials, and other sensitive values while preserving syntax.
3. Add the capture to `test/fixtures/` with a descriptive `_fail.txt` name.
4. Add a focused case to the file for the tool's family in `test/tools/` -
   `test/tools/python.js` for a Python tool - covering the tool name, failure count,
   location, title, message, and summary. A tool in no family there gets a file of its
   own, run from `test:fast`; `test/suites.js` fails until it is.
5. Add the extractor to `src/extractors/` and register it in `src/index.js`.
   Keep detection specific enough that existing fixtures do not cross-detect, and
   bound what `extract` reads — see "Bound what a parser reads" below.
6. Add the tool to the `docs/supported-tools.md` table and changelog, and name its row for the
   parser in `test/support.json`.

An extractor declares itself: `{ name, category, commands, signals, detect, extract }`, where
`category` is one of `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `compile`, `build`, `runtime`,
`package`, `vcs`, `deploy` or `unknown` (`unknown` belongs to the fallback alone), and `commands` lists the command names that imply it.

`signals` lists strings a log has to hold for the parser to read anything from it: at
least one of them is in every log `detect` accepts. A parser is not asked about a log
holding none of them, which is what keeps a large log fast - see `src/router.js`. Take
them from `detect` itself, one from each way it can succeed, and keep each free of line
breaks. `test/router.js` fails if `detect` ever accepts a log without one; a parser left
without `signals` is asked about every log.

Every failure says which lines of the text the parser was given it was read from:
`withSource(failure, start, end)` from `src/ownership.js`, end exclusive. Two tools'
readings of the same lines are one diagnosis, and a failure without a range can never be
recognised as one. `test/evidence.js` holds each range to the text it points at, and
`test/fuzz.js` holds every parser to writing one on damaged logs too. The ranges are what a
report gives as each failure's `evidence`, moved onto the lines of the output itself.

Extractors should return `{ tool, summary, failures }`. A failure holds the fields
`report.schema.json` documents and no others - `file`, `line`, `col`, `title`, `message`,
`stmt`, `trace` and the rest - and leaves out what the tool did not print rather than
setting it to `null`. `line` and `col` count from 1: pylint, webpack, Babel and esbuild
count columns from 0, and their parsers add one. Where the tool draws a caret under the
source line, the column is where the caret is - check it against one. `test/report.js` holds every parser's result
on every fixture to this, and a field nothing documents fails it.

A failure should also say what it is. Set exactly one of `code` (a diagnostic
identifier), `subject` (the name of the site that failed) or `label` (a constant the
tool prints for a class of failure), plus `severity`. Grouping depends on this: a `code`
identifies a problem and stays in the fingerprint, while a `subject` is the axis being
grouped across and never enters it. Setting none means the failure clusters on its
message alone, which is safe but inert.
Warnings, notes, framework internals, and summary counters should not become
failures unless they are actionable diagnostics.

## Admitting a tool

A new tool, or a new format of one already read, comes in with all of these. Each is held
by a test that fails without it, and most of those tests find a new parser or fixture on
their own - nothing has to be registered with them.

| It comes with | Held by |
|---|---|
| a real capture of a failing run, which its parser reads | `test/detectors.js` |
| a case in its family's file in `test/tools/`, which reads that capture | `test/support.js`, `test/suites.js` |
| a row in `docs/supported-tools.md`, named for its parser in `test/support.json` | `test/support.js` |
| `signals`, the strings a log has to hold for it, or a reason in `test/support.json` why it can have none | `test/support.js`, `test/router.js` |
| a written range for every failure, on its captures and on damaged logs | `test/evidence.js`, `test/fuzz.js` |
| a report that keeps to `report.schema.json`, and columns that count from 1 | `test/report.js` |
| no new claim on another tool's captures | `test/detectors.js`, whose matrix fails on any change until `--update` writes it again, for a review to read |
| every pair of captures, itself included, read as the two read apart | `test/mixed.js` |
| a reading that takes time in proportion to the log | `test/bounds.js` |
| a guess that says it is one, and output it cannot read handed back | `test/guarantees.js`, `test/tools/generic.js`, `test/cli.js` |

What no test can hold: that the capture is real, from the tool, on a machine, and not
written to look like it - which is the first step above - and that the case says what a
reader of that tool would want said.

## Bound what a parser reads

This is the mistake this codebase makes most often, and detection is not where it
happens. `detect` decides whether a parser is asked at all; `extract` then reads the
whole log unless it is told not to. In a log holding two tools — which is the ordinary
case in CI — that means reading the other tool's output.

The markers are not distinctive. `error:` is written by cargo, deno, git, kubectl,
sass, terraform and half the rest. `N) name` is written by jasmine, mocha, rspec,
PHPUnit and Playwright. `not ok` by tap and `node --test`. `file:line:col:` by every
compiler there is. A parser that scans for one of those across a whole log will find
somebody else's.

Bound the scan with something the tool itself declares:

- a **count** — mocha says `2 failing`, so it reads two blocks and stops
- a **section** — jasmine's blocks live between `Failures:` and its tally; PHPUnit's
  between `There were N failures:` and where its run ends
- **adjacency** — deno writes `error:` on the line under its header, rustc puts `-->`
  on the line after, vitest's assertion is one line below `FAIL`
- **the very next thing it said** — `terraform init` narrates what it is doing, so its
  error is the first line after the last step, and nothing further down is its

A distance window is usually still too loose: a dozen lines was enough for terraform to
reach past its own output into sass's. Prefer a structural bound over a numeric one.

Two rules that fall out of the same problem:

- A diagnostic cannot own a stack that another diagnostic stands in front of. Stop a
  frame search at the next error line, not merely after N lines.
- A tool's own line prefix is not a wrapper. npm leads every line with `npm `, and
  stripping it leaves npm's parser matching nothing.

`test/mixed.js` is what catches all of this: it concatenates every ordered pair of
fixtures and asserts the combination recovers exactly the failures the two recover
apart. It is at zero and should stay there. A new parser that breaks it has not been
bounded.

## Safety and quality

- `npm run coverage` runs the tools themselves: a small broken project per tool, the
  command that fails on it, and what came back. It is not a test - it needs the tools
  installed and reaches the network - but it is how a claim about what whyitbroke reads
  gets re-made on another machine instead of quoted from whenever it was last measured.
  A tool that is not installed is skipped and said so.
- Run `npm test` before submitting changes. `test/guarantees.js` runs first and pins the
  two promises everything else is subordinate to: the exit code is the command's own,
  and a command that failed is never presented as anything else. If a change makes those
  fail, the change is wrong, not the test.
- A parser's `summary` must say that something went wrong. A tool's own tally often does
  not: jest prints `Tests: 0 total` when a suite throws before declaring one, and rspec
  prints `0 examples, 0 failures`. Both were real headlines over real failures, and both
  read as though nothing had happened. `test/guarantees.js` asserts this over every
  fixture.
- Keep source reads confined to the working directory.
- Never add network calls or runtime dependencies for a parser.
- Add malformed-input coverage when a parser has ambiguous or multiline syntax.
- Do not include secrets or private source code in fixtures.
- Rewrite the capturing machine's paths to `/home/dev` before committing a fixture. A temp
  or scratch directory, or a home directory with a username in it, is not tool output -
  and because a path never changes what a log reads as, nothing else in the suite will
  notice one left behind. `test/detectors.js` checks for it. Change the paths and
  nothing else.

## Requesting a parser

Include the tool name, version, operating system, a redacted failing output
sample, and the expected concise result. Redact secrets before posting logs.
