  // Two more words real tools use where none of the others appear. `set -u` is how a
  // careful CI script is written, and the shell reports it as "deploy.sh: line 4: FOO:
  // unbound variable" - nothing else in that sentence says anything went wrong. sed and
  // awk say "unterminated address regex" and "unterminated string", and so do several
  // compilers. Both are rare enough outside a diagnostic to carry their own weight.
  // The name may be followed by what the tool was doing when it failed. Go writes its
  // errors that way and so does everything built on it: "open /app/compose.yaml: no such
  // file or directory", "validating /app/compose.yaml: services.api.ports must be a
  // array", "dial tcp 10.0.0.1:80: connect: connection refused". Anchoring on the name
  // and its colon meant none of those were read, and `docker compose` says three of its
  // four failures in exactly that form. A few words, not a sentence - the vocabulary
  // below is still what says the line is about something going wrong.
  // The classic unix shape - "curl: (7) Failed to connect", "cp: cannot stat",
  // "ssh: ... Connection refused". A bare "prog: message" is far too broad to
  // treat as an error, so it must also say that something did not work.
  // The vocabulary is the failure words a unix tool actually uses, and it was written
  // around verbs. That missed the nouns: `tar: Error opening archive: Unrecognized
  // archive format` and `awk: syntax error at source line 1` both name themselves and
  // then say plainly that something broke, and neither produced any diagnosis at all -
  // the word is not immediately before a colon, so the pattern above it never fired.
  // ...and the same shape when the program is named by its path. A shell says
  // "/bin/sh: nosuchcommand: not found", env says "/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or
  // directory", and Docker BuildKit quotes the first of those for every RUN that fails -
  // the cause of the build failing, under BuildKit's own line saying that it did.
  // Requiring the line to start with the program's NAME meant none of them were read.
  //
  // The path has to start at a root or at the directory: "/bin/sh", "./scripts/deploy.sh".
  // Allowing a bare relative one would take a source file with it, because that is the
  // same shape - stylelint's compact format writes "src/shop.css: line 3, col 15, error -
  // Disallowed unit", and with the vocabulary below being what it is, this claimed it.
