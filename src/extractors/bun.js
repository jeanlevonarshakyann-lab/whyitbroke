// Reading forward from the "(fail)" line therefore gave every failure the NEXT one's
// message and location, and gave the last one the run's tally - "0 pass" reported as a
// test's assertion. Every bun run with more than one failure was wrong that way, and
// the corpus could not show it: the only fixture was a run of 192 near-identical
// parameterised cases whose blocks differ by one character.
//
// A block belongs to the "(fail)" line under it, back as far as the previous one. A
// "(fail)" whose block is not in the log - the capture began mid-run, which is how that
// fixture was taken - is still a test bun said had failed, and is still reported.
//
// Note bun writes "error:" at the start of a line, which the cargo parser also
// looks for - so this must be registered ahead of it.
// With colour on, bun draws a cross where it writes "(fail)" without it - the same
// line, the same name, the same timing. Reading only the word meant a run with
// FORCE_COLOR set, or a terminal-emulating CI, produced no bun failure at all and fell to
// the generic reader, which kept "error:" in each message and named no test.
//
// The cross is not bun's alone: vite ends a failed build with "✗ Build failed in 26ms".
// What bun's line always carries and vite's never does is the timing in brackets at the
// end, so for the cross that bracket is required.
